# Intelligent Resume Screening System using Machine Learning

**Project Overview:**

Manual resume screening is time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. This project implements an AI-powered resume screening system that automatically analyzes resumes and predicts candidate suitability for job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

The system can:

▪️ Preprocess resumes and job descriptions.

▪️ Match resumes to job descriptions based on textual similarity.

▪️ Shortlist top candidates automatically.

**Features:**

✅ Preprocessing of resumes and job descriptions using NLP

✅ TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

✅ Cosine similarity for matching resumes to jobs

✅ Optional ML classifier (Logistic Regression) for job role prediction

✅ Only shortlisted candidates (similarity_score >= threshold) are saved

✅ Visualization with confusion matrix (readable axes)

✅ Fully implemented in Python (Google Colab compatible)

**Technologies Used:**

⭕️ Python 3

⭕️ Pandas & Numpy

⭕️ Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Cosine Similarity)

⭕️ NLTK (text preprocessing)

⭕️ Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

⭕️ Google Colab
